Ultra low cost IR timing gate transponder compatible with i-lap rc timing gates. How low can you go? We've seen builds as cheap as $3 per transponder!
[Now with a detailed build guide!](http://mrickert.com/2016/10/12/building-your-own-coreir-transponder/)


Comes ready for you to input any 7 digit transponder ID you'd like, edit the arduino file to set which transponder ID to use.

ID range: 1111111 to 9999999

Required parts:
* Arduino pro mini or pro micro (pro micro preferred)
* 9.1 ohm resistor
* npn transistor (2N222 preferred)
* IR led (TSAL6400 preferred)
