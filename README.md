Ultra low cost IR timing gate transponder compatible with i-lap rc timing gates. How low can you go? We've seen builds as cheap as $3 per transponder!

Comes ready for you to input any 7 digit transponder ID you'd like, edit the arduino file to set which transponder ID to use.
ID range: 2097152 to 9999999

Required parts:
* Arduino nano or pro mini (5v pro mini preferred)
* 9.1 ohm resistor
* npn transistor (2N222 preferred)
* IR led (TSAL6400 preferred)
